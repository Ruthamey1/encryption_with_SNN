# Encoding Audio to Image Frames with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) - Split Encoding/Decoding

This repository contains the code for the **audio encoding** stage of a project that aims to represent audio signals within image frames collectively making a video using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The encoding and decoding stages have been separated into distinct repositories for better organization and to allow GitHub to effectively display the codebase.

**Overview of the Project:**

The goal of this project is to explore the potential of using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to encrypt information within images or videos.
